I like to build cool shit.

Outside of coding, youâ€™ll often find me:
- ðŸŽ® Playing and making video games  
- ðŸŽ£ Relaxing with a fishing rod in hand  
- ðŸš¶ Taking long walks to recharge and find inspiration

I'm building [Unveil](https://unveilengine.com), a 2D and 3D AI game engine to build your dream game.
