I like to build cool shit.

Outside of coding, you’ll often find me:
- 🎮 Playing and making video games  
- 🎣 Relaxing with a fishing rod in hand  
- 🚶 Taking long walks to recharge and find inspiration

I'm building [Unveil](https://github.com/Unveil-gg), a game tools company to help build your dream game.
